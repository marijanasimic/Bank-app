Bank is simple on-page site, with small bank application for users. I was created two account, and it is possible to login with user ms and PIN 1111, or user jk and PIN 2222.
In application user can check the balance on the bank account, transfer money to another userâ€™s account, loan money and delete account.
All transactions in application can be done in 2 min, and the date of each transaction is recorded.

Here I fetch a JSON file across the network and in the end of the process get the country data needed for the application (flag, country name and region).

HTML5, SASS, JavaScript, 
Dates, Timers, Fetch API, JSON
